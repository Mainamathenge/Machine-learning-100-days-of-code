# Machine-learning-100-days-of-code
## PROJECT 1
this is may day 16 of 100 day of code for my AI and Ml challange i have learnt about the basic algolothims of machine learnig 
to challange myself i created this small project using _Open CV __ ,__Tensorflow__,Matplotlib__, to create an Image detction model I used a pretrained [__MOBILENET-SSD-V3__](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssd_mobilenet_v3_large_coco_2020_01_14.tar.gz)
model to come to come up with an object dtection model that could detect over 80 objects in an image in real time with Opencv.
