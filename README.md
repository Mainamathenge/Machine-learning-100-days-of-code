# Machine-learning-100-days-of-code
In this project I used OpenCv Tensorflow Matplotlib machine learning platforms and I used a pretrained model from Tensorflow [MobileNet-SSD V3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UNpttDb1u4OiNFVAC2pxz7Oz2vAF5ee0/view?usp=sharing) and I created and an object detection model that could detect 80 diffrent object in an image with OpenCV
